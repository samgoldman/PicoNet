Packet format (60 bytes, not including the standard 4 byte header):
    - 1 byte: packet type (1 bit forwarding, )
    - 1 byte: packet ID
    - 1 byte: packet origin
    - 1 byte: packet destination
    - 4 bytes: packet timestamp (reserved)
    - 1 byte: payload type (i.e. temperature)
    - 1 byte: payload device ID (i.e., RFM temperature vs. pico temperature)
    - Remaining: data - format defined by data type and data origin

Node types:
    - Base station
    - Remote node

Packet types:
    - Command
    - Response
    - Telemetry - this is a modifier on the packet type
    - Forward
    - Discovery
    - TOF estimation - Responds immediately after subsequent TOF packets. Used to estimate time difference. Must be in TOF mode for accuracy
    - Time update

Known Devices
    - All nodes have a list of devices that they can directly send a packet to

Sensing conops:
    - Remote node R1 logs sensor readings at configurable frequency, storing those readings with timestamps
    - Base station B1 sends a command to R1 to
