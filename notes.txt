Packet format (60 bytes, not including the standard 4 byte header):
    - 1 byte: packet type (1 bit forwarding, )
    - 1 byte: packet ID
    - 1 byte: packet origin
    - 1 byte: packet destination
    - 4 bytes: packet timestamp (reserved)
    - 1 byte: payload type (i.e. temperature)
    - 1 byte: payload device ID (i.e., RFM temperature vs. pico temperature)
    - Remaining: data - format defined by data type and data origin

Node types:
    - Base station
    - Remote node

Packet types:
    - Command
    - Response
    - Telemetry - this is a modifier on the packet type
    - Forward
    - Discovery
    - TOF estimation - Responds immediately after subsequent TOF packets. Used to estimate time difference. Must be in TOF mode for accuracy
    - Time update

Known Devices
    - All nodes have a list of devices that they can directly send a packet to

Sensing conops:
    - Remote node R1 logs sensor readings at configurable frequency, storing those readings with timestamps
    - Base station B1 sends a command to R1 to 


Components:
    * Watchdog implementation
    * FS manager:
        * OTA config updates
        * OTA source updates
    * Sensors
    * Telemetry manager - perhaps not actually a component - stores telemetry for retrieval
    * Reboot manager
    * Component manager
    * TOF handler
    * Time sync

Linux:
    * MQTT & relevant commanding
    * Data logging
    * Pi zero?

Improvements:
    * Try-catch on non-critical Components
    * Non-critical components don't restart when in safemode
